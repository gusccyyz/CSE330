	Due: Wed. May 27 for bothe sections. (Monday 5/25 is Memorial Day, a Holiday)

	Implement a Stack class, completing the attached template (file: "Stack_templ.cpp"), using a linked list of strings.

	Supply operations size, push, pop, and top, just like in the standard stack template.

	For testing (and to turn in): push "John", "Jane", "Wen"; then pop the stack 2 times, printing the top in each case. Then push "Audrey", "Alice", "Teresa"; then pop two times, printing the top in each time.

	Print the size of the stack. Print the contents of the stack, popping until empty.

	Header for the code (standard for all labs, with appropriate adjustments of course like for the lab title,etc.):
