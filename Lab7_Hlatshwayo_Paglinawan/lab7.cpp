/*
1. Implement the sieve of Eratosthenes: a function for computing prime
numbers, known to the ancient Greeks. Choose an integer n. This function will
compute all prime numbers up to n. First insert all numbers from 1 to n into a set.
Then erase all multiples of 2 (except 2); that is, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, …. Erase all multiples
of 3, that is, 6, 9, 12, 15, … . Go up to 1,000. The remaining numbers are all primes. (The program for his part largely exists in the textbook.)

2. Repeat the problem above but instead of a set use a vector.

3. Find the prime numbers up to 1,000 by running the two programs in 1 and 2.  Give the time it took to run each.  State which is faster and by how much.  For example if 1 runs 2 ms and 2 runs 5ms, then 1 is 5/2=2.5 faster than 2.

To obtain credit:
1. A single document in zip format that contains (1) the source code with the ususal
header at the top and (2) the run (typescript) that shows the output.
2. The name of the le should be CSE_330_LabX_Lastname1_Lastname2.zip. Upload on
Blackboard. That would be the o cial turn-in time.
3. A hardcopy of the above at the beginning of the lab session on the due date. 
4. Be ready to demo the programs in the lab on the due date.
